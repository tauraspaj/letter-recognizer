# Different types of letter recognition

## Printed letter recognition
Generated custom data set and trained the system with KNN method. Implemented SVM for comparison.

## Handwritten letter recognition
Using EMNIST data set with neural network training method. Implemented KNN and SVM for comparison.

## Signature recognition
Generated custom data set to experiment with binary classifiers. Used CNN as the main training method and implemented KNN and SVM for comparison.
